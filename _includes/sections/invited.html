	<h2><strong>Onboard Evolution of Understandable Swarm Behaviours</strong></h2>
		<p align="left" style= "cmax-width:600px; word-wrap:break-word;">
		Designing the individual robot rules that give rise to emergent swarm behaviours is difficult. <br>
		The common method of running evolutionary algorithms to automatically discover controllers <br>
		in simulation suffers from a major disadvantage; the evolved controllers are often opaque <br>
		and hard to understand. We use behaviour trees as the controller architecture because they <br>
		are modular, hierarchical and human understandable. We evolve fit controllers in a swarm with <br>
		high processing power, use automatic tools to simplify them, and then explain them, an important <br>
		factor for safety and acceptance. We look at the design of a suitable behaviour tree architecture, <br> 
		applying the techniques of Genetic Programming to behaviour trees, the implementation of a fast <br>
		 parallel simulator and tree interpreter running on the GPUs of our swarm of robots, how large <br>
		 evolved trees can be automatically simplified to aid analysis, and then explain one of the <br>
		 evolved controllers.

	<h2><strong>Behavioral Reactivity: Using Reactive Programming to Create Behavior Trees</strong></h2>
		<p align="left" style= "cmax-width:400px; word-wrap:break-word;">
We will present how to apply reactive programming to the design of robot behavior tree. <br> 
Using this paradigm, user defines branches and then associate them with rules of activation. <br>
Contrary to other approaches, the behavior tree is not traversed at runtime. Rather the branches <br>
compete continuously one with another for activation. And because branches can be attached to <br>
targets (discretized high level sensor entities), the activation of a branch will correspond to <br> 
the activation of a specific set of sensory motor couplings that will shape the behavior of the robot.<br>
As various videos will show, this programming paradigm supports rich and complex behaviors <br> 
characterized by high behavioral reactivity. Playful, our open-source reactive programming <br>
interpreter supporting behavior trees, will be introduced. Our more recent work exploring <br> 
the automated generation of reactive programming scripts from human demonstration will also be discussed.

	<h2><strong>Practical application of Behavior trees for industrial robot task design</strong></h2>
		<p align="left" style= "cmax-width:400px; word-wrap:break-word;">
Reconfigure collaborative robots on new tasks quickly and efficiently is today one <br>
of the great challenges for manufacturing industries. In this respect, behavior trees<br>
already proved to be a great tool to design and execute complex coordination schemes<br>
that are hierarchical, highly modular and with a predicable outcome. Nevertheless,<br>
being a state-less logic in their classical form, BT have more problems representing <br>
sequences w.r.t. other approaches such as e.g. FSMs. In this presentation we will see <br>
how we adapted the classical BT model to fit in a working framework that encompases <br>
dynamic planning, BTs optimization and knowledge management.
